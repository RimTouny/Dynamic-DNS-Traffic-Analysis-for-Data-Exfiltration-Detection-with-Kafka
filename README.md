# **Enhanced Data Exfiltration Detection via Dynamic DNS Traffic Analysis usng Kafka**
Crafting static and dynamic models for data exfiltration detection via DNS traffic analysis using . Static model trained on batch data [Static_dataset.csv](https://github.com/RimTouny/Dynamic-DNS-Traffic-Analysis-for-Data-Exfiltration-Detection-with-Kafka/files/13904748/Static_dataset.csv) while dynamic model simulates a continuous stream[Kafka_dataset.csv](https://github.com/RimTouny/Dynamic-DNS-Traffic-Analysis-for-Data-Exfiltration-Detection-with-Kafka/files/13904759/Kafka_dataset.csv) [that should treat as a data stream (local Kafka Server) which will be used to evaluate the dynamic model] . Rigorous analysis, feature engineering, and model training conducted. Implementation part of AI for Cyber Security Master's assignment at the University of Ottawa, 2023.
